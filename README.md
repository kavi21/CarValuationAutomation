# CarValuationAutomation
IdentityTask

Description: This project automates car valuation testing on motorway.co.uk. Initially, I encountered several errors, which have now been fixed. However, due to excessive request limits, the website now displays "Too Many Requests" errors.
So the tests may fail.
I am submitting the updated files for review. Please go through them and share your feedback.

Instructions for Running the Tests:

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the tests using:
pytest tests/test_car_valuation.py
